How to use a blog based on Danube Delta?
========================================

For the sake of this user guide let's assume your blog is ``blog.python.cz``.

Installation
------------

Windows
~~~~~~~

Choose location on your disk where the blog is going to live. Let's say
``D:\blog.python.cz``. First, let's go to ``D:\``:

::

    C:\Users\kvetoslava> D:

Then let's clone blog's repository:

::

    $ git clone https://github.com/pyvec/blog.python.cz.git
    $ cd blog.python.cz

Then let's create a virtualenv folder and activate the virtualenv. Use Python 3,
please.

::

    D:\blog.python.cz> python -m venv venv
    D:\blog.python.cz> venv\Scripts\activate.bat

Now we need to install dependencies. Because Windows are the most
ridiculous OS on the planet, you can't just install whatever is in the
``requirements.txt`` file by ``pip``. You need to:

1.  Make sure you have the latest ``pip``. It's important.

    ::

        (venv) D:\blog.python.cz> python -m pip install pip --upgrade

2.  Now proceed with standard installation:

    ::

        (venv) D:\blog.python.cz> pip install -r requirements.txt

If everything went correctly, you should be ready at this point. You can
test everything works properly by running ``blog --help``:

::

    (venv) D:\blog.python.cz> blog --help

Linux / MacOS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Choose location on your disk where the blog is going to live. Let's say
``~/blog.python.cz``. Now let's clone blog's repository:

::

    $ git clone https://github.com/pyvec/blog.python.cz.git ~/blog.python.cz
    $ cd ~/blog.python.cz

Then let's create a virtualenv folder and activate the virtualenv. Use Python 3,
please.

::

    ~/blog.python.cz/$ python3 -m venv venv
    ~/blog.python.cz/$ . ./venv/bin/activate

If ``python3 -m venv venv`` fails with error, try ``python3 -m venv venv --without-pip`` instead. Now we need to install dependencies:

::

    (venv) ~/blog.python.cz/$ pip install -r requirements.txt

If everything went correctly, you should be ready at this point. You can
test everything works properly by running ``blog --help``:

::

    (venv) ~/blog.python.cz/$ blog --help

Writing Articles
----------------

1.  Before using the blog, you need to go to the directory where it lives
    and activate virtualenv. If ``blog --help`` doesn't work, then you're
    not ready yet.

2.  Before writing, make sure you download other people's changes from
    GitHub:

    ::

        blog update

3.  To start a new article, use:

    ::

        blog write

4.  To add photos to the article you just started, use:

    ::

        blog photos ../../my-photos/album/

    It should work also with a single picture:

    ::

        blog photos ../../my-photos/album/24340826629_d5bb5abb9e_o.jpg

5.  To locally verify how your changes are going to look like, use:

    ::

        blog preview

6.  When ready, publish your changes:

    ::

        blog publish

    When published, check `Travis
    CI <https://travis-ci.org/pyvec/blog.python.cz>`__ for possible
    errors. If it's green and there are no errors, the blog was
    successfully published and should be accessible from
    `blog.python.cz <http://blog.python.cz/>`__ in a minute or two.
